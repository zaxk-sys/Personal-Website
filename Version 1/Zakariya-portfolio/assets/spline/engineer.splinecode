# PLACEHOLDER - SPLINE 3D SCENE FILE

This file should be replaced with an actual .splinecode file exported from Spline.

## Instructions:

1. Open Spline Desktop Application (https://spline.design)
2. Create a new 3D scene with:
   - 3D hologram-style engineer silhouette
   - Neon blue (#00F5FF) and purple (#B026FF) materials
   - Floating DevOps icons (Azure, Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform)
   - Particle field
   - Neon grid
   - Breathing/idle animation loop
3. Export as .splinecode format
4. Replace this file with the exported engineer.splinecode

## Scene Requirements:

- Dimensions: 600x600px
- Animation: Looped, 3-5 second breathing cycle
- Colors: Cyan (#00F5FF) and Purple (#B026FF)
- Style: Cyberpunk hologram with distortion effects
- Performance: Lightweight, optimized for web

The scene will automatically load in the hero section once the .splinecode file is placed here.
